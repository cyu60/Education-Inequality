      <h1>Educational Inequality</h1>
      <h3 id="team">Mathias Insley, Keidai Lee, Chinat Yu, Pinhong He</h3>
      <h3 id="ecaGap" class="divider line glow"><u>The Extracurricular Gap</u></h3>
      <p>
        It’s no secret: many problems permeate American education, and access to 
        extracurricular activities is one of the largest inequities present. 
        Low-income and racial minority students are at a structural disadvantage 
        when it comes to accessing extracurricular activities, being three times 
        less likely to participate in after-school programs<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Research has documented 
        a consistently positive relationship between extracurricular 
        participation and educational backgrounds<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. More specifically, a student's 
        participation in extracurricular activities has been linked to self-confidence, 
        commitment to school values, heightened educational expectations, improved grades, 
        higher standardized test scores, better cognitive & noncognitive skills, retention, 
        and long-term outcomes such as college enrollment and college completion<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. 
        The COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated and perpetuated the worsening disparities 
        in access to extracurricular activities<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.
      </p>

        The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics expects STEM occupations to 
        grow by 8% between 2019 and 2029, compared to 3.4% for non-STEM 
        occupations<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Wages for STEM occupations are also estimated to be more 
        than double those of non-STEM, potentially providing a pathway to 
        financial independence for students from low-income communities.

        Research shows that the experience students have with STEM in 
        extracurricular settings can have a profound effect on their decision to 
        pursue STEM in college or as a career. Students benefit immensely from 
        the opportunity to engage in hands-on, informal STEM learning in 
        environments that provide encouragement <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Over the last decade, after 
        school programs have become a crucial means of access to these sorts of 
        environments.

        Furthermore, after school extracurriculars in STEM are providing 
        learning opportunities in demographic groups traditionally 
        underrepresented in STEM. Hispanic and Black workers continue to 
        be underrepresented in the STEM workforce, while White and Asian 
        workers are overrepresented. Socioeconomically speaking, however, 
        all races are disadvantaged<a href="#ref7">[7]</a>.

      <p>
        Despite the clear importance of extracurricular STEM education, access 
        is less available to families with lower incomes and under-resourced 
        regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        (For this graphic, 'lowest income' refers to annual income under $25,000 and 'highest income' refers to incomes of $200,000+.)

        Further, barriers to participation have been increasing. Compared to 
        2014, challenges related to cost, transportation, and availability have 
        increased.

        Looking at the geographic distribution of where facilities for 
        extracurricular activities can occur, it is clear that access is not 
        uniform across the United States.

      <p>
        While it is clear that the need for after school STEM extracurriculars exists, 
        barriers to participation have increased. Thus, these facts indicate that there 
        needs to be greater investment in STEM extracurriculars from the federal, state, 
        and local level. Schools do more than just provide academics: they are also spaces 
        for social and emotional support, safety, food systems, and health care systems<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>. 
        Both public and private investment in STEM extracurriculars are needed now more than 
        ever: students need a diversity of experiences inspiring learning and success, both 
        in school and in life.
